# Queens-Backtracker
Program that finds a configuration to put n queens on a chess board such that no queen is in danger of being attacked by
another queen in any of the cardinal directions or diagonals.

Usage: java queen_project.QueenProject \<filename\> \<CLI or GUI\>

You can change the format of the input file and it should still work,

board.
